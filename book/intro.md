# Blended Studio User Manual

Welcome to the user manual for the Blended Recording Studio located in Room 2.1 of the Teaching Lab. This manual is a work in progress and is to be considered a working draft until an official release is made.

For now, the pages of the book contain the TeachBook template pages. Approved authors are free to play around with the book and try adding and modifying pages as per the [Teachbook Manual](https://teachbooks.io/manual/intro/book.html "https://teachbooks.io/manual/intro/book.html") instructions.

TAs from various faculties working with their Blended Learning Developer who feel they should have editing access to this book should email C.D.Rans@tudelft.nl to request editing access.
